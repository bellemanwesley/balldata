Various projects doing sports simulation and data analysis.

# nbagen.py
nbagen.py generates 30 lists with three entries. The first entry is team ID. The second is number of wins and the third is number of losses. The generator currently only generates for 76 games as it does not account for the 4th game that NBA teams play with only some of their in-conference, but out of division opponents. 

While the wins and losses are randomly generated, they are generated based on an assigned skill level at the beginning of the program. This is intended to mirror prospects of NBA teams in real life.
